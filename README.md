# Udemy Course - Java
My personal work for lectures and assignments in a Java course (from beginner to advanced) by Udemy.

Name of the course: Universidad Java 2021 - De Cero a Experto!

Link to the course (it's in Spanish): https://www.udemy.com/share/101WlwB0sYeFdWR3o=/

I translated all the code comments, names used (for classes, variables, etc), and more from Spanish to English.
